- Hello! My name is Thomas.
- My interests lie in everything technology, but especially game design!
- I'm currently learning many different fields of design and development best practices.
    - Unreal Engine 5.2 (C++ and Blueprints)
    - OpenGL with C++
    - C++17/20 concepts
    - and more! 
- My repositories mainly consist of the aforementioned learning projects with solid foundations.
- ðŸ“« If you'd like to contact me, I encourage you to message me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-tran-2021/) or email me at thuantran07@hotmail.com
