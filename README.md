- Hello! My name is Thomas.
- My interests lie in everything technology, but especially Video Game Development!
- I'm currently learning many different fields of design and development best practices.
    - Unreal Engine 5.2 (C++ and Blueprints)
    - JavaScript
    - Twitch API with Websockets
    - NodeJS 
    - and more! 
- My repositories mainly consist of the aforementioned learning projects with solid foundations.
